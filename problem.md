Guess the character
Congratulations on getting past the interview stage to get here ðŸŽ‰
This is an exercise to test to assess if you are able to solve problems with readable, well-written code, that employs software design principles or patterns.
Overview
ï¿¼
kahoot.it
Build a small game where the player needs to correctly guess the film or tv-show of a Disney character.
* Use an API to get images and characters information, for example https://disneyapi.dev/. You do not need to use this exact API.
* You can make the game look however you want not necessarily like the image above
* Once the game has been completed it should be uploaded to a cloud hosting service of your choice and share the link. Share the GitHub repository, or zip of the code.
    * You may also issue us with a docker image (or images + docker compose file) if you do not access to a cloud hosting service.
Game rules
* each game has 10 rounds
* each round should display a picture of the character and 4 answers, one of them being the correct one
* the player only has one guess per round
* characters for each round should appear randomly
* at the end of the 10 rounds, the total score should be displayed
Criteria
If time is a limiting factor, not all game rules need to be implemented. However please fill these criteria so we can understand your front and backend skills.
* There must be a front, and backend component to this game. (i.e. cannot be written all in the front end as a Single Page Application)
* Frontend
    * Serves the user interface
    * Submits the users answers to the backend
* Backend
    * Makes the external call to your API of choice
    * Receives the submission request from your frontend
    * Redirects the user to the next round
    * You may use in-memory session storage (i.e. you do not need to use a persistence service like Redis)
Mid to senior criteria
For candidates applying for the SE2, or Senior SE1+ roles, please also follow these criteria
* Describe which technologies or libraries youâ€™ve used and why
* Describe a software design pattern you have used (e.g. REST, MVC, inversion of control)
Stretch goals
Please only consider doing these once your game contains all the basic rules and criteria.
* Ensure that this game works with and without javascript
* write tests, or describe your testing plan
